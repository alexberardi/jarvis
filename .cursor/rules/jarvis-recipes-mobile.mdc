# jarvis-recipes-mobile

Mobile recipes app. React Native + TypeScript + Expo. More mature than jarvis-node-mobile.

## Running

```bash
npm install                    # Install dependencies
npx expo start                 # Start Expo dev client
npm run ios                    # iOS
npm run android                # Android
npm run web                    # Web version
npm run dev:ios                # Open simulator + iOS (iPhone 15)
npm run dev-full:ios           # Full prebuild + iOS
```

## Testing

```bash
npm test                       # Jest
```

## Purpose

Browse recipes, meal planning, and interact with the recipe system. Can send images (recipe photos, screenshots) for OCR-based recipe import.

## Tech Stack

- React Native + Expo + TypeScript
- Jest for testing

## Service Dependencies

- `jarvis-auth` (7701) - User authentication
- `jarvis-recipes-server` (7030) - Recipe CRUD, URL import, meal planning (primary server)

**Design goal:** Clients should talk only to their respective server, which acts as passthrough to auth and other services.
